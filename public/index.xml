We learned with an early &amp;lsquo;edu-tainment game&amp;rsquo; called PAWS on the school&#39;s Commodore 64s. For me, the most frustrating part came when we were done with a lesson. We were allowed to play games; but the teacher had to &amp;lsquo;review&amp;rsquo; the lesson with you.</description>
