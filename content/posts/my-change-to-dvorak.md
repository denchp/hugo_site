## Practice Makes Permanent

Like most people who started their education after 1982 - I started learning to type in elementary school, which was admittedly a long time ago. We learned with a 'game' called PAWS on the school Commodore 64s.  For me, the most frustrating part was that when we were don with a lesson, we could play games!  But the teacher had to 'review' the lesson with you.  This review consisted of the teacher coming over and holding a piece of paper over your hands while you re-attempted the lesson.  Which I could never do well.

I hated that.

Despite that 'training', and typing hundreds of papers and code projects through middle school, high school, and college - I never developed good typing habits.  I could type fast and accurately; but it was far from efficient.  My hands generally looked like two highly-caffeinated spiders dancing on a hot skillet.  No one really noticed, but I was always self-conscious about my habits.

From time to time I would half-heartedly pledge to improve my typing, focus on the home row for a week, and then eventually revert to the dancing spiders...

## The Decision to Change

I heard about the Dvorak layout in highschool and thought it would be interesting to learn, but I was never willing to go from the Lambada that I had adopted in order to learn to dance all over again.

But something changed late in 2019...

I watched a few developers streaming their development on twitch.tv, and a few were simply *amazing* typists.  My poor self-image of my typing habits rocketed forward in my mind. A few of the streamers gave recommendations on how to improve your typing on their personal pages.  After some review I found that one common theme from their recommendations was to **focus on using the right fingers to strike the right keys every time, all the time**.  I resolved to try and improve my habits (again).

I quickly discovered that I couldn't possibly spend enough time trying to correct my bad habits when I spent 8 hour work days - and 10 hours a week on my own stream - reinforcing my bad habits.

Then I saw a developer streaming his Dvorak set-up.

It was instant geek-envy as he was quickly tapping away on [one of these bad boys](https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Keyboard-Typists-KB600QD/dp/B01KBKFT7C).

At that point I came to understand that if I was going to *really* improve my typing I would have to start completely over.  I'd have to set a match to my previous bad habits, and grind through learning to type properly. I also realized with a change to Dvorak I would learn a more efficient layout, fix my long ingrained habits, and instantly gain +9 geek-cred.

## The First Month

As a full-time developer I knew I couldn't just change my layout and suffer through agonizing months of low productivity.  Instead I opted to install the Dvorak keyboard layout on my PC so I could switch to it easily, and ease my way in. 

I started off using https://learn.dvorak.nl as my main training site.  The advantage of the site is that it focuses on progressively adding keys, starting with the 'home 8' (aoeu and htns) and working up to the full 26 characters (no punctuation). I worked on each lesson until I was typing around 10-12 WPM, then moved on.

Once I could at least recall the position of each key, and type at a reasonable pace (with occasional pauses to remember where the Q and J keys are hiding), I decided to switch to Dvorak 100%.  I was eager to do this for two reasons:

1. It felt like 'taking the training wheels off'. This was a big step and confirmed that I was *actually* going to do this!

2. While having both QWERTY and Dvorak installed on my PC was convenient, occasionally I'd accidently switch between them (it is hot-keyed to Shift+Tab by default).  These accidental switches would completely interrupt whatever I was doing while I had to go back and figure out where exactly I made the switch.

## Taking The Plunge

After about a month I finally removed the QWERTY layout from my home **and** work PC.  I still had a QWERTY keyboard, but they acted like a Dvorak.  I was fully committed to using Dvorak.

It was a painful time.

I quickly found that messaging people through any means (discord, slack, teams) was *extremely* slow. Which had the odd effect of making me actually think about how to say what I needed to - in the fewest possible words; just to avoid typing.

Coding was a little better since there isn't a lot of 'free-form' typing.  Re-learning where things like the braces '{}' and the hyphen '-' were took some time.  

The most frustrating thing for me was that I had to expend significantly more effort thinking about my typing - which took away from my ability to think about how I wanted my code to work.  This was a *major* frustration, especially as I was streaming my project.  Instead of being able to fluidly talk about the code as I typed, *and* thinking about what I had to do next; I found I had to explain what I was about to code, type some code, then think about the impact of that code and what had to be done next.  *Switching to Dvorak made me go from executing three tasks in parallel, to just one*.

## Ramping Up the Training

Shortly after making my switch I found keybr.com.  It supports Dvorak, and (in my opinion) was much more rigorous than the learn.dvorak.nl site.  The additional feedback, progress report, and even the fact that it gave me my performance in WPM* helped me focus in on my weaknesses, and quantify my improvements.

As I realized I needed to significantly improve my speed I started using the new tools *as much as possible*.  Any time I found myself with idle hands on my computer I'd pull up keybr.com and start practicing.

Over and over I practiced, and I steadily got faster and faster.  Within a month I was at a respectable, if not blazing fast 25 WPM, after two I was pushing 45 WPM and now (another month in) I'm working to get to 60 WPM.

(* learn.dvorak.nl lets you type 100 words and tells you how fast you typed them, so figuring out my WPM required some math) 

## Results and Lessons Learned

While 60 WPM doesn't sound like much, I'm proud to say that I have near perfect form in my typing.  I still use a QWERTY keyboard, so looking at the keyboard does nothing for me.  Instead, I can focus on the screen, and what I'm typing; instead of shamefully glancing back at the dancing spiders.

I've also had other developers who have claimed to type 65-75 WPM (QWERTY) fail miserably on keybr.com, turning in scores in the low 40s.  I'm (perhaps *finally*) confident in my typing habits, and even the speed that I type at.

I'll continue to work on my speed because it's become habit at this point.  I spend 15-45 minutes a day on keybr's practice drills, whether I'm watching Netflix at home, waiting for code to compile, or a query to run, I keep the window open so I can jump in and get a little more practice.

Is Dvorak Better?

: No.

Dvorak is definitely a different experience than QWERTY, but that's also probably because I'm learning differently.
