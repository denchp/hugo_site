## Practice Makes Permanent

Like most people who started their education after 1982 - I started learning to type in elementary school, which was admittedly a long time ago. We learned with an early 'edu-tainment game' called PAWS on the school's Commodore 64s.  For me, the most frustrating part came when we were done with a lesson.  We were allowed to play games; but the teacher had to 'review' the lesson with you.  This 'review' consisted of the teacher coming over and holding a piece of paper over your hands while you re-attempted the lesson.  Which I could never do well.

I hated that - enough so that I can still envision that teacher's face and her holding that piece of paper as I struggled to type with that pixelated cat incessantly smiling at me...

Despite that 'training', and typing hundreds of reports, stories, and code projects through middle school, high school, and college - I never developed good typing habits.  I could type fast and relatively accurately; but it was far from efficient.  My hands generally looked like two highly-caffeinated spiders dancing on a hot skillet.  No one really noticed, but I was always self-conscious about my habits.

From time to time I would half-heartedly pledge to improve my typing, focus on the home row for a week, and then eventually revert to the dancing spiders...

## The Decision to Change

I heard about the Dvorak layout long ago in highschool and thought it would be interesting to learn, but I was never willing to go from the Lambada that I had adopted in order to learn to dance all over again.

But something changed late in 2019...

I watched a few developers streaming their development on twitch.tv, and a few were simply *amazing* typists.  My poor self-image of my typing habits rocketed forward in my mind. A few of the streamers gave recommendations on how to improve your typing on their personal pages.  After some review I found that one common theme from their recommendations was to **focus on using the right fingers to strike the right keys every time, all the time**.  I resolved to try and improve my habits (again).

*I quickly discovered that I couldn't possibly spend enough time trying to correct my bad habits when I spent 8 hour work days - and 10 hours a week on my own stream - reinforcing my bad habits.*

Then I saw a developer streaming his Dvorak set-up.

It was instant geek-envy as he was quickly tapping away on [one of these bad boys](https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Keyboard-Typists-KB600QD/dp/B01KBKFT7C).

At that point I came to understand that if I was going to *really* improve my typing I would have to start completely over.  I'd have to set a match to my previous bad habits, and grind through learning to type properly. I also realized with a change to Dvorak I would learn a more efficient layout, fix my long ingrained habits, and instantly gain +9 geek-cred.

## The First Month

As a full-time developer I knew I couldn't just change my layout and suffer through agonizing months of low productivity.  Instead I opted to install the Dvorak keyboard layout on my PCs (work and home) so I could switch to it easily, and ease my way in. 

I started off using https://learn.dvorak.nl as my main training site.  The advantage of the site is that it focuses on progressively adding keys, starting with the 'home 8' (aoeu and htns) and working up to the full 26 characters (no punctuation). I worked on each lesson until I was typing around 10-12 WPM, then moved on.

Once I could at least recall the position of each key, and type at a reasonable pace (with occasional pauses to remember where the Q, J, and K keys were hiding), I decided to switch to Dvorak 100%.  I was eager to do this for two reasons:

1. It felt like 'taking the training wheels off'. This was a big step and confirmed that I was *actually* going to do this!

2. While having both QWERTY and Dvorak installed on my PC was convenient at first, occasionally I'd accidentally switch between them (it is hot-keyed to Shift+Tab by default).  These accidental switches would completely interrupt whatever I was doing while I had to go back and figure out where exactly I made the switch.

## Taking The Plunge

After about a month I finally removed the QWERTY layout from my home **and** work PC.  I still had a QWERTY keyboard, but they acted like a Dvorak.  I was fully committed to using Dvorak.

It was a painful time.

I quickly found that messaging people through any means (discord, slack, teams) was *extremely* slow. Which had the odd effect of making me actually think about how to say what I needed to;3 in the fewest possible words; just to avoid typing.

Coding was a little better since there isn't a lot of 'free-form' typing.  Re-learning where things like the braces '{}' and the hyphen '-' were did take some time.  

The most frustrating thing for me was that I had to expend significantly more effort thinking about my typing - which took away from my ability to think about how I wanted my code to work.  This was a **major** frustration, especially as I was streaming my personal development project.  Instead of being able to fluidly talk about the code as I typed, *and* thinking about what I had to do next; I found I had to explain what I was about to code, type some code, then think about the impact of that code and what had to be done next.  *Switching to Dvorak made me go from executing three tasks in parallel, to just one*.

## Ramping Up the Training

Shortly after making my switch to Dvorak 100% I found keybr.com.  It supports Dvorak, and (in my opinion) was much more rigorous than the learn.dvorak.nl site.  The additional feedback, profile reports, and even the fact that it gave me my performance in WPM helped me focus in on my weaknesses, and quantify my improvements.


>learn.dvorak.nl lets you type 100 words and tells you how fast you typed them, so figuring out my WPM required some math

As I realized I needed to significantly improve my speed I started using the new tools *as much as possible*.  Any time I found myself with idle hands on my computer I'd pull up keybr.com and start practicing.

Over and over I practiced, and I steadily got faster and faster.  Within a month I was at a respectable, if not blazing fast 25 WPM, after two I was pushing 45 WPM and now (another month in) I'm working to get to 60 WPM.


## Results and Lessons Learned

While 60 WPM doesn't sound like much, I'm proud to say that I have near perfect form in my typing.  I still use a QWERTY keyboard, so looking at the keyboard does nothing for me.  Instead, I can focus on the screen, and what I'm typing; instead of shamefully glancing back at the dancing spiders.

I've also had other developers who have claimed to type 65-75 WPM (QWERTY) fail miserably on keybr.com, turning in scores in the low 40s.  I'm (perhaps *finally*) confident in my typing habits, and even the speed that I type at.

I'll continue to work on my speed because it's become habit at this point.  I spend 15-45 minutes a day on keybr's practice drills, whether I'm watching Netflix at home, waiting for code to compile, or a query to run, I keep the window open so I can jump in and get a little more practice.

Is Dvorak Better?
: No.
: Dvorak is definitely a different experience than QWERTY, but that's also probably because I'm learning differently.  It is ostensibly 'more efficient', but most of the stories about the origins of QWERTY (e.g., it was designed to slow typists down) are complete fabrications.  The origins of the layout are far more nuanced.  And while Dvorak was designed with efficiency in mind, the benefits are (in my opinion) immeasurably small.

What about switching back and forth between Dvorak and QWERTY?
: As far as the learning process has gone, I'm glad I took the plunge on the computers I use everyday.  I think if I had kept switching back and forth my learning would have been extremely stunted.
: I do find it difficult to go to someone elses' computer to help them.  It's a very jarring experience.  It does feel a bit like the 'vegan trope' where any vegan will explain their veganism with barely any prompting.  But, I do find I have to explain why I'm suddenly mystified by their unfamiliar keyboard layout.

Should I Switch?

: Sure!  Why not?
: But, if it's just because you're expecting huge gains in typing speeds - don't.  As I said, I'm about 3-4 months into this change and am starting to push towards 60 WPM - which is about what I typed before the change.
: If you want to re-invent your typing habits - definitely.

## Update 1/27/2020

I find it hard to believe that I'm already writing an update to this blog post, but here I am.  No, I'm not quitting Dvorak, I'm upping my goal.  10 days ago when I posted this I was stretching to get to 60.  I would guess I was averaging around 55WPM.  That average is now over 60, and I've managed to hit 80+ wpm on keybr.com.  While it's not 'real' typing, it's the most standard measurement I have.  I'm still a bit slower when typing blog posts, or even 'real' typing tests that have excerpts from text.  But the reality is, I *still* can't look at my keyboard, and I'm *still* getting faster.

As I said before, Dvorak isn't inherently better than QWERTY, but the learning process I'm using has significantly changed my habits.  Whether you black-out your keyboard, get a Das Keyboard, or adopt a new layout: if you want to fix your bad habits, the best option is to *start over from scratch*.

## Update 4/8/2020

I'm still using Dvorak, and still seeing improvements in my typing.  At this point I don't feel any significant difference with my days of QWERTY typing, aside from the fact that I don't look at the keyboard *at all*.  There are a few keys that still give me trouble (such as -, =, and sometimes /).  But those will come too I imagine.  I mostly run into them when programming - but I do enough of that that even the odd-ball keys are becoming more natural.

I'm averaging around 70+ WPM on keybr, but I've now peaked at 96.4 WPM.  I'm still pushing to get my average up; I think my next goal is averaging 90+.  The gains don't 'feel' like the big leap from when I first changed to Dvorak full-time, likely because going from 30WPM to 60WPM is doubling my speed - while a change from 60 to 80 is not even a 50% improvement.  It's still significant, but it doesn't *feel* like the leap from 20-40, or 30-60.
